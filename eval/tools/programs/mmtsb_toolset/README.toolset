*** Installation ******

To install, go to the directory where you want to install
the package (e.g. /usr/local) and unpack with 

   gzip -d <package>.tar.gz
   tar xvf <package>.tar

This will create all files in the current directory

Now start the installation with
   
   ./install.sh 

or 
   ./install.sh INTEL

Using the optional key INTEL on the command line will use the Intel
compilers (note that the Intel fortran library libifcore must be directly
used to enable linking c++ and fortran codes using the icpc and this
requires the path -L /path_to_intel_fortran_libs/ be set. This will probably
have to be changed in the Makefile for differing installations.

The default compiler is the GNU compilers, gcc, g++ and gfortran.

After running the installation script compiled binaries are available
in ./bin and self-starting perl scripts are in ./perl. Related data
files are in ./data and examples for each perl script are under
./bench.

*** Setup ******

Every user planning to use the MMTSB tools should set the
environment variable MMTSBDIR to the directory where the MMTSB
tools are installed (e.g. /usr/local) and include $MMTSBDIR/bin
and $MMTSBDIR/perl in the file search path as follows:

For csh/tcsh:

setenv MMTSBDIR <installation-dir>
set path = ( $path $MMTSBDIR/perl $MMTSBDIR/bin )

and for sh/bash:

export MMTSBDIR = <installation-dir>
export PATH = $PATH:$MMTSBDIR/perl:$MMTSBDIR/bin

For parallel execution, you may also specify the program
for remote login without passwords in REMOTESHELL, e.g.:

setenv REMOTESHELL rsh


*** Integration with other packages ****

The MMTSB Tool Set benefits from the availability of other
software packages, in particular CHARMM, Amber, NAMD, Modeller,
DSSP, SCWRL, NCBI-BLAST, PSIPRED. Note that the Tool Set now works
with installation of either scwrl3 or scwrl2.5.

To use SCWRL3.x with the Tool Set, unpack the tarball, copy the files
BBDep.bin and scwrl3_ to the directory $MMTSBDIR/data directory, run the
setup program that resides in the scwrl3_<os> from the $MMTSBDIR/data 
directory, and then move the executable scwrl3 to the $MMTSBDIR/bin 
directory (this is necessary because the path to the BBDep.bin is explicitly
encoded into scwrl3).

The following environment variables are related to these
packages and should be set accordingly:

CHARMMEXEC    CHARMM executable
CHARMMDATA    CHARMM data files
AMBERHOME     Amber installation directory
SANDEREXEC    Amber sander executable
LEAPEXEC      Amber tLeap executable
NAMDEXEC      NAMD executable
MODELLEREXEC  Modeller executable
PSIPREDDIR    PSIPRED installation directory
PDBDIR        Directory with local copy of PDB 

*** Troubleshooting ***

Perl:

Perl 5.004 or newer is required to run the perl scripts. All perl scripts
check whether this (or a newer) version is available and and will
abort with a message if not. /usr/bin/env is used to find the location
of perl. This works only if perl can be found in the search path. 
An error like

  env: perl: No such file or directory

indicates that perl is either not installed or its location is not 
included in the search path. Binary and source code distributions of 
latest perl versions are available through http://www.cpan.org


Compiling:

The provided Makefile by default uses gcc, g++, and gfortran to compile 
the binaries. If that is not appropriate for your platform
or special linker options are needed, the file src/Makefile
needs to be modified accordingly. Please consult your 
local system administrator if necessary.

Running:

If problems occur with running the scripts or programs please  
consult the documentation at 
http://mmtsb.scripps.edu/software/mmtsbtoolset.html
and check your input data. 
If problems persist, help is available at the address below.
